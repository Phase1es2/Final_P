    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>
      Taking place in 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, move
      into an old house in the country to be closer to the hospital where their mother Yasuko is recovering from a
      long-term illness. Satsuki and Mei find that the house is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called
      Sootballs - small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. While the girls can
      see them, their father can't, however an elderly woman (whom the girls can call Granny) tells them she used to see
      Soot sprits when she was their age. She explains that they live in old empty house and cover the place with dirt,
      when a family moves into the house they move out and find a new home. Soon they all get to work cleaning the house
      and unpacking. Later on, Granny's grandson and their new neighbor Kanta comes by with a basket but acts shy around
      Satsuki. When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their father, the soot spirits leave
      the house to drift away on the wind. It is implied that they are going to find another empty house- their natural
      habitat.

      Soon they go to the hospital to visit their mom who is improving, the doctors say that she should be able to come
      home in 2 weeks. The next day, Satsuki starts class at her new school with Mitchiko her new friend. While Tatsuo
      grades papers at home Mei goes off exploring, soon she sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass and follows
      the ears under the house. She discovers two small magical creatures who lead her through a briar patch and into
      the hollow of a large camphor tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit, which
      identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as Totoro. She falls asleep atop the large Totoro, but
      when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground in a dense briar clearing. Despite her many attempts, Mei is unable
      to show her family Totoro's tree. Her father comforts her by telling her that this is the spirit of the forest,
      and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. When they find the tree, the hole is gone, while Satsuki is
      disappointed, she is assured that she will see him if she's lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Satsuki leaves Mei with Kanta's parents and Granny for the day, however towards the end of the day,
      Granny and Mei are outside the school house. As it turns out, Mei had been crying and wouldn't stop until she saw
      Satsuki, she tells Mei she has to stay with Granny since their father is teaching at the University and she has
      school. Despite her assurance, Mei wants to stay with her sister, so after talking to her teacher, Mei is welcome
      to stay and is giving some crayons and paper, Satsuki is slightly embarrassed. At the end of the school day it
      starts to rain, the girls make it run for it but Mei trips and gets mud on her face and dress. The girls wait in a
      temple until the rain lightens up, Kanta walks by and gives the girls his umbrella and runs home, the girls are
      grateful. At home, Satsuki works on her homework and Mei does some art. Soon it's time to pick up their father
      from the bus stop but first they drop off Kanta's umbrella, Kanta's mom is glad to hear Kanta didn't forget the
      umbrella he gave it to the girls. The girls head to the bus stop but their father is not on so they wait, Satsuki
      asks Mei if she wants to wait at Granny's but Mei says no. They continue waiting for their father's bus and grow
      worried as time wears on and it becomes dark. As they wait, Mei eventually falls asleep on Satsuki's back and
      Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. He only has a leaf on his head for
      protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken along for their father. Totoro is
      delighted as both the shelter and the sounds made upon it by falling raindrops. He likes it so much he jumps and
      makes all the drops fall on the umbrella and lets out a roar which wakes Mei and the rain stops. Soon another bus
      comes but it's a bus-shaped giant cat (known as the Catbus), in gratitude, he gives the girls a bundle of nuts and
      seeds. Totoro boards the bus, taking the umbrella, Satsuki is in shock and wonders what they'll tell their father
      about his umbrella. Shortly after, their father's bus arrives and he explains the train was crowded so he had to
      wait for the for the next bus. The girls tell him what they saw and are in excitement as well, then they head
      home.

    <p>
      Satuski writes to their mom and tells her everything that happened that day The girls plant the seeds they got but
      they aren't growing and Mei watches them everyday waiting for them to sprout. A few days later, the girls sleep
      outde in the heat and are awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his two miniature colleagues engaged in a
      ceremonial dance around the planted nuts and seeds. The girls join in, whereupon the seeds sprout and then grow
      and combine into an enormous tree. Totoro takes his colleagues and the girls for a ride on a magical flying top.
      they become the wind blowing across the lawn and play a flute Totoro gives them from the tree. In the morning, the
      tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted which means they weren't dreaming after all.

    <p>
      Some time later, the girls are helping Granny harvest some vegetables and Mei wants to give her Mom the corn she
      picked. The girls find out from a telegram that Mom's hospital wants them to call the doctor. Kanta takes Satuski
      to his Uncle's house to use the phone, Mei follows them despite being told to stay with Granny. Mei gets separated
      and runs into a goat. Satuski contacts her father and says he'll call the number and get back to her. As it turns
      out a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Satsuki, disappointed and
      worried, tells Mei the bad news, which Mei does not take well. This leads into an argument between the two, ending
      in Satsuki angrily yelling at Mei and stomping off. Mei starts to cry and Kanta walks with her, back at the house
      the girls go to different parts of the house to be alone. While Satuski helps Granny with the laundry she is
      assured their mom will be home next Saturday but Satuski points out that was the same news they got each time,
      Satuski becomes really upset and worried their Mom may die. After seeing her sister upset, Mei decides to walk to
      the hospital to bring some fresh corn to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, Satuski ask everyone she sees if they've
      seen her, they are in shock they Mei actually tried to walk over 3 hours to get to the hospital. It starts to
      become dark and Satuski and the neighbors are more worried than ever. Eventually, Satsuki returns in desperation
      to the camphor tree and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to be of assistance, he summons the Catbus, which
      carries her to where the lost Mei sits. Having rescued her, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the
      countryside to see their mother in the hospital. The girls perch in a tree outside of the hospital, overhearing a
      conversation between their parents and discovering that she has been kept in hospital by a cold and is otherwise
      doing well, their mother still can't believe the doctor would send a telegram over something this minor. The girls
      secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by the parents, and return home on the
      Catbus. When the Catbus departs, it disappears from the girls' sight. Granny is happy that Mei is safe and Kanta
      apologizes for how he acted.

      In the end credits, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, with Totoro
      and his friends as unseen observers.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The film was originally a medium-length project of about 60 minutes, and it took more work to release. To
      cooperate with "My Neighbor Totoro," Ghibli launched the novella "Grave of the Fireflies" directed by Isao
      Takahata at the same time. But the final two works are long-form projects with a duration of about 90 minutes. On
      April 16, 1988, two animated films with entirely different themes and styles were released on the same day.
